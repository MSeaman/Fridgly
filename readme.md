Fridgly
by Andrew Carton, Mark Hagopian and Matthew Seaman

Fridgly is a kitchen ingredient management and recipe seach app.  It allows the user to manage ingredients in the 'fridge' and  'pantry, and from these collections, select ingredients to search for recipes.

The 'pantry' is a collection of ingredients that the user is assumed to always have. This feature is designed to provide a consistent set of ingredients to match against required recipe ingredients, allowing the user to see which are missing from his or her kitchen.

The 'fridge' is a collection of recently aquired ingredients to be used as recipe search parameters.  The 'advancedSearch' can perform queries filtering recipes for multiple parameters including holiday theme, allergy, cuisine type, course, and diet. Searches can be further tailored by setting max and min values for a number of values including spicy, sweet, sour, bitter, and meaty.

Recipe search results return the name of the recipe, its required ingredients, and which of those required ingredients your fridge and pantry lack.  Clicking on a recipe result will show its full recipe page.
